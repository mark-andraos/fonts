🧩 How to use Transfonter

Go to 👉 https://transfonter.org

Click “Add fonts” and upload your .ttf file.

In the options:

Check WOFF2 (you can uncheck the others if you only want that).

Leave everything else on default (no need to subset or rename unless you want to).

Click “Convert”.

Download the ZIP and extract the .woff2 file.

Upload that file to your GitHub repo (or wherever you’re hosting fonts).
